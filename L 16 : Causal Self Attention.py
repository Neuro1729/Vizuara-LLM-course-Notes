Simple just while calculating attention make future ones 0 . we mask out attention weights above diagonal or make them 0 and then we normalize the non masked attention weights such that they all sum to 1
Lower triangular matrix has values above diagonal = 0 . torch.tril gives lower triangular matrix and triu gives upper triangular matrix . SO one way is create attention scores matrix make upper ones zero
renormalize and then got scores . another way is create upper mask replace all values with -inf then automatically softmax doing will make them 0 and sum upto 1 .

In transformer architecture including GPT one way is after getting attention score after masking complete so if we have dropout = 0.5 then in each row 50 percent of attention weight in each row will be turned off
